Note: This was a group project work done for CityU's GE2127 Computer-Aided Visual Design and Electonic Art

# Code structure and libraries

The minim library was used to load mp3 audio and play background soundtrack for different game scenes.

Code structure is at the most basic level: menu, turtle (stage 1), ocean (stage 2), polar bear (stage 3)

# Developer's Note

This is the first programming project that I worked on with a team,
the code components and structure is a complete mess but it was really fun to get a working prototype going that ran without crashing :D

TODOs:
- Refactor the code to break down responsibilties into components
- Improve the gameplay experience
- Fix the weird/near-creepy BGM vibe
